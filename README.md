# Social media
Social media is a pet project whose main goal is to provide people from all corners of the world with the opportunity to exchange thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Each user can not only maintain their own blog but also create chat groups for messaging that bring together multiple users. The exchange of posts, comments, and messages occurs in real-time. Additionally, users can quickly find each other based on shared interests.
